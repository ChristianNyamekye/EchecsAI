JSON return should be formatted in a way that can be easily parsed by doing the following: Remove the backticks: Ensure that the JSON data being sent and received does not include Markdown like triple backticks (```) or other extraneous characters. Check both the sending and receiving ends of your data transfer. Correct JSON Key Syntax: JSON keys should be enclosed in double quotes. Your JSON keys such as recommended, player_to_move, etc., are correct, but ensure all are consistently formatted. Correct Data Formatting: Make sure the entire structure of the JSON data is correct, including commas, brackets, and braces. ",
